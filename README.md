# Pathfinding-Visualizer
## What is this?
Implementation of a pygame script which simulates an environment that helps with not only the visualization of two of the most popular, efficient pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm and A* Search Algorithm, but also their difference regarding efficiency. To successfully implement this program requires a significant amount of understanding in terms of how the algorithms work as well as the abilities to design OOP concepts in an abstract and coherent manner.
