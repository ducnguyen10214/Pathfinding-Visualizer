# Pathfinding-Visualizer

Implementation of a pygame script which simulates an environment that visualizes two of the most popular pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm and A* Search Algorithm, and also their difference regarding efficiency.

# Documentation
- At the beginning of the simulation, users pick the starting node and the ending node.
- Proceed to draw out the obstacles manually / generate the obstacles automatically using `Generate DFS Maze`.
- Choose either `A*` or `Djikstra` shortest-path algorithms to find the shortest path between the starting node and the ending node.

# Confidentiality
- Duc Nguyen's personal project.
