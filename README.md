# Pathfinding-Visualizer
Implementation of a pygame script which simulates an environment that helps with the visualization of two of the most popular, efficient pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm and A* Search Algorithm. To successfully implement this program requires a signifcant amount of understanding in terms of how the alogrithms work as well as the abilities to design concepts in an abstract and coherent manners.

There is a Windows executable file in "build", which was constructed using cx_freeze on a Windows machine.
